<p>What follows is H. Rackham's translation, as printed in the 1914 Loeb edition, with words at least partially represented in Lorem ipsum highlighted:[8]

   [32] But I must explain to you how all this mistaken
   idea of reprobating pleasure and extolling pain arose.
  To do so, I will give you a complete account of the system,
   and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer 
   of the truth, the <span style="background:red;"> master-builder</span> of human happiness. 
   No one rejects, dislikes or avoids pleasure itself, 
   because it is pleasure, but because those who do not
    know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences 
that are extremely painful.
